# OptimaETA

A maps app to show you how travel time and ETA evolves in the next few minutes or hours for a given destination.

OptimaETA is a learning exercise on MapKit / CoreLocation and SwiftChart.

When ready, it will allow the user to search for destinations in the surrounding area. They will appear as Markers on the map, alongside Features automatically shown by MapKit.

The user can then select either Markers retrieved from the search or automatically shown Features as destination, and the App will show the available routes with travel time estimates.

An ETA button on the UI will also allow the user to see a sheet with charts shwoing how estimates for each available route progress in time.

With those charts, the user can find the optimize travel time by leaving at the perfect time to still arrive before desired ETA.

**Note:** this app is an exercise, and travel times and ETAs are estimates generated by MapKit based on traffic statistics. The results shown on the app do not constitute professional advice or any form of promise on actual travel performance.
